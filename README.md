Welcome to the Macintosh UI Library!

this readme file will help you operate this ui library for your own use!

# How to use the ui!

- To start, you will need to add the configure loadstring!
 this configure file stores the gui for later use.
```lua
local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berrizscript/macintosh/refs/heads/main/configure"))()
```

- After, you will need to *load* the window, using this code block!
This loads the window to start the gui!
```lua
local Window = Library:CreateWindow("Untitled Window")
```
^ Change ”Untitled Window” to your selected name.
